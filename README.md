# NHL_321_PointSystem
This project is to take a look to see what the NHL's standings would be if they went to a 3-2-1 point system.

Brief overview of what the 3-2-1 point system is:
3 points -> Regulation win
2 points -> Overtime/Shootout win
1 point -> Overtime/Shootout lose

To make this happen I am using Python and the BeautifulSoup library to web scrape the NHL standings on hockey-reference.com along with some data manipulation to come up with the new standings.
